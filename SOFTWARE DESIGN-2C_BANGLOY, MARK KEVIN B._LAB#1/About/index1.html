                        Basketball is my favorite hobby of all time!
                        I got involved in basketball because I was interested in the sport.
                        Basketball is a great way of exercise and a great way to have fun with friends and possibly make some new ones. 
                        I love to watch and play the game, basketball is a very entertaining sport and can be played by anyone.
                        Basketball has many negative and positive things about it based on my opinion.
                        Basketball is known as a good pastime in many people is eyes but can also be seen as a passion for many others.

                        Friendship is one of the greatest bonds anyone can ever wish for.
                        Lucky are those who have friends they can trust.
                        Friendship is a devoted relationship between two individuals.
                        They both feel immense care and love for each other. Usually,
                        a friendship is shared by two people who have similar interests and feelings.

                        Animes teach viewers lessons such as sacrifice, love, faith, and more. 
                        Animes are not only good graphics and great dialogues.
                        Lessons await you in every episode or movie you are watching.
